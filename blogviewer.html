        Since the middle of March, every individual and business across the country has drastically changed their daily habits and practices. People have self-isolated and been forced to work from home. Businesses have run the spectrum from temporarily closing to limiting service to remaining fully operational while increasing their health and safety protocols. Very little is the same now as it was just a few months ago.<br>

Unfortunately, that also includes the unemployment rate, which skyrocketed in the weeks following the coronavirus outbreak. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, more than 30 million Americans filed unemployment claims from mid-March through the end of April. That figure represents approximately 18.6 percent of the nation’s labor force.<br>

Under these current dire circumstances, many people may believe the outlook for business ownership is bleak.  Fortunately for many franchises, small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs, I do not believe that is the case. Regardless of the current situation, franchise development officials are always focused on the future. Expansion takes months or years of planning, relationship building and precise execution to find the best candidates. In that respect, the business of franchise development continues as usual.<br><br>

<strong>The future of franchising</strong><br>
As a franchise coach, I am aware of only one franchisor in the United States that has temporarily discontinued new business development. All the others are continuing with plan for franchise development almost the exact same way they did previously.  The only major difference is they are not doing in-person discovery days. They have moved to virtual discovery days, virtual site selections, etc.  In some cases, these new experiences can provide a more impressive presentation or insight into the company with a highly produced video and multimedia package.<br>

As franchisors continue to pursue new franchise candidates, they have made some concessions to help others as they start their business.  A lot of franchisors have offered some very attractive discounts and incentives for new franchisees.  These offers may last only a short period of time until later this year. Some companies are also being more flexible about the period of time in which a new business must open by giving an additional grace period due to the uncertainty of this current situation.<br>

With so many people being furloughed or laid off and businesses losing revenue over the past two months, I think there is a general perception that this is a bad time to invest in a business.  Overall, I would actually say this is a good time to open a business. Warren Buffett very famously said,  "When people are greedy, be fearful and when people are fearful, be greedy." It is very similar psychology to the stock market when people buy when it is high and sell when it is low.  There is a lot of truth to that. <br><br>

People can become paralyzed by fear during uncertain times and they can miss a great opportunity. As a result of the fear people currently have, there are a lot of opportunities today that weren’t there previously. Companies now have a larger pool of potential employees, while real estate is more available now than it was several months ago.  There are a lot of opportunities in this kind of economy. By taking advantage of this now, it can position people well once the economy strengthens. <br><br>

<strong>Franchising advantages</strong><br>
People who are uncertain if this is the right time to invest in a franchise should consider some of its advantages. By nature, owning a franchise comes with less operating risk than an independent business, and that should be reassuring during this current climate. The fundamental value proposition of franchising is that it provides more security, predictability and a greater chance at success. <br><br>

In an odd way, the impact of the coronavirus situation may actually push people to explore business ownership.  Whether people are furloughed from their job, fear for the long-term security of their current position or don’t want to start anew with another company, this is the time when they want to exercise greater control over their careers. People also have more available time to research these opportunities and plan for their future while isolated at home and are spending more time online than ever before.<br>

Some early data from aspiring franchise owners support that theory. A buyer sentiment survey from Franchise Insights shows that the majority of aspiring franchisees believe the next three months will be a good time to start a franchise business, and that general business conditions will improve. Only 19.2 percent of the respondents indicated they would be putting plans for their small business startup search on hold as a result of COVID-19.<br>

I imagine many of the people that took part in this survey began exploring their opportunities for business ownership months ago in a far different climate and continue to have the same optimistic outlook for their professional future.<br><br>

From the franchise prospects’ perspective, very little has changed as they explore business ownership.  Our banking system is still very solid and the same financial assistance remains in place. Nothing has changed with the due diligence process, either.  It is still vitally important to research which franchise is the best fit and provides the best opportunity for success.  This includes carefully reviewing FDD’s, speaking with franchisors and franchisees within the system and building a detailed Profit & Loss (P&L) statement.<br>

The last several months have been a difficult time for everyone. We know this period will come to an end and bring a return to normalcy, but we just don’t know when that will occur. The opportunity for business ownership is a silver lining to a very dark cloud that hovers over the year of 2020.<br>

        Most companies fear competition from a rival’s product innovations and the risk of falling behind their industry’s technological frontier. Firms affected by such competitive pressure usually react by trying to strengthen their R&D capabilities and close the gap between their and their rival’s technologies as quickly as possible. But how exactly can firms catch up? Our research shows that rather than innovating from scratch in house or partnering with others in strategic alliances, the most effective solution may be to buy access to an already existing technology and incorporate it into your R&D.<br>

When we studied how 206 publicly listed biopharmaceutical firms reacted to their rivals’ new product launches, we saw firms approaching catch-up R&D in three different ways. Some relied solely on internal development, while others drew on external knowledge by entering into strategic alliances and collaborating with outside partners. Other companies used technology licensing. Of these three strategies, we found that that the latter was most effective in allowing firms to generate innovation in areas in which they had been attacked and close the R&D gap competitors had created. The effect was particularly salient in technological domains in which firms had significant investments and commitments. Put differently, when existing investments were at stake, licensing was the best way for firms to preserve their competitive position.<br>
<br>
<strong>Licensing and Innovation in the Biopharmaceutical Industry</strong><br>

Our study examined how licensing has been an important knowledge-sourcing tool in the biopharmaceutical space over the last decade. This industry has experienced rapid technological change grounded in the form of new research tools such as immunoassay, gene sequencing, and high throughput screening, as well as new therapies such as monoclonal antibodies, stem cells, and oligonucleotides. The industry is also highly competitive, as firms continuously move new therapeutic treatments towards regulatory approval. As a result, they face an increasing need to update and upgrade their R&D capabilities if they are to sustain the development of their pipeline and continually bring new drugs to market.
<br>
We found that licensing gives firms the ability to more quickly adjust to this shifting competitive landscape. The 206 firms we sampled engaged in more than 4,500 licensing transactions over a period of 15 years (1989-2004). We observed that licensing intensified after competitors launched products in therapeutic areas where our focal firms where actively pursuing R&D activities. For example, in 2003 and 2004 there was a spike in licensing deals related to monoclonal antibodies following Abbott’s successful development and launch of Humira, a monoclonal antibody targeting rheumatoid arthritis. Many of Abbott’s direct competitors, such as Genzyme and Boehringer Ingelheim, then licensed in monoclonal antibody technologies for rheumatoid arthritis, while competitors like AstraZeneca and Pfizer licensed the technology to develop new therapies in autoimmune diseases in general. Licensing deals related to monoclonal antibodies increased by more than 25%.
<br>
Our study also focused on the innovation outcomes of licensing activities. We examined firms’ abilities to channel the knowledge sourced through licensing towards areas in which they faced competition. We found that this strategy was used primarily to ensure that a firm’s portfolio of technologies remained competitive and current, allowing them to gear their R&D efforts to match competitors’ moves (i.e., a type of problemistic search). In particular, we found that, following a licensing, firms increase their number of new patents in specific areas threatened by rivals (such as autoimmune diseases). We did not observe the same effect for alliances, which suggests that this strategy should not be the first choice for a firm wanted to beef up its R&D to catch up to a rival with new technologies.
<br><br>
<strong>Why Licensing Works</strong><br>

Licensing has three major characteristics that make it particularly useful:<br>

<ul>
<li>Coordination. In technology licensing, the licensor (firm selling the technology) agrees to unilaterally transfer know-how and intellectual property (IP) related to a technology to the licensee (firm buying the technology). A licensing contract represents a commercial transaction in which one firm sells and the other buys a technology. Compared to strategic alliances, this significantly reduces the need for coordination between the firms involved.</li>
<li>Focus. Licensees can determine the type and characteristics of the technology they wish to acquire before entering a deal.  Firms can define the specific gaps or deficiencies in their R&D technology relative to competitors, which makes licensing particularly appropriate those who are attempting to react to competitors’ moves.</li>
<li>Speed. With licensing, firms can promptly tap into and use ready-made external R&D solutions. This approach saves not only time but also the resources that would otherwise have to be committed to the trial-and-error process of developing solutions from scratch. Research shows that firms can reduce innovation time by an up to 19% if technology licensing is used as an input to their R&D.</li></ul>
<br>
<strong>When to Choose Licensing</strong>
<br>
While we found that licensing is particularly relevant when firms want to compete with their rivals heads-on, we also found that it is much less effective when firms are exploring new technological avenues to shield themselves from rival pressures. This indicates that companies are not likely to choose licensing when they want to move into novel or relatively unexplored areas of R&D.
<br>
There are also risks in the use of technology licensing. For example, once firms regularly license new technologies, they may become overly reliant on knowledge generated externally, which can weaken their ability to innovate internally. So it should be used more parsimoniously by firms trying to build internal R&D capacity in strategic technological fields.
<br>
When competitors develop new technologies, it can destabilize the industry landscape. Managers must carefully assess the alternatives on which they rely to adjust their firm’s R&D. Our research suggests that licensing might be the best way to directly and quickly respond to rivals’ innovations and remain competitive. `;
