                    You are in fact building at least two very different but linked business structures, one for you as
                    franchisor and one for your partners in business, your franchisees.
                    <br>
                    Your franchisees will take responsibility for dealing with your clients or customers, and they bring
                    in the money. Your franchisees will be doing much of the technical work your business now
                    concentrates on.
                    <br>
                    You, as the franchisor, and leader of the franchise group, need to make sure everything is working
                    and that you provide the right support to give your franchisees the best chance of success.

                    So yes, one of your core roles as the franchisor is to look after your franchisees. And this will
                    involve different skills with different franchisees as they grow in your partnership.
                    <br>
                    In the early days, you will be inducting them into the franchise, teaching most of them exactly how
                    you want them to do business:
                <ul style="text-align: justify;font-size: 15px;">

                    <li> How to make up the burger to meet your customers' expectations.</li>

                    <li> How to interact with your customers.</li>

                    <li> How to make your business look and feel.</li>

                    <li> You will also be teaching many of them the basics of business â€” all about accounts,
                        advertising, converting leads to sales.</li>
                </ul>

                </p>`;
        let b = document.getElementById('exampleModalLabel1').innerHTML = "FRANCHISOR SUPPORT";
    }
    function OpenPdf2() {
        let a = document.getElementById('modal-body1');
   
        a.innerHTML = `         <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;padding: 10px;color: black;height: auto;">
                    Looking after your brand and marketing is also a central responsibility for any franchisor.
                    Marketing in a franchise, as with any business, involves far more than just advertising.
                    <br>
                    First, and most importantly, you need to understand the market that loves your product. Make sure
                    you have a product which has a sustainable tribe of raving fans. And then work out how big you want
                    the franchise group to be. Marry the two and make sure your product is presented to your tribe in a
                    way which will satisfy their every desire.
                    <br>
                    And remember, it is the characteristics of this tribe of raving fans which will provide the details
                    for you to work out your franchisee territories, which in turn feed into your fee structures. Great
                    fee structures and profit will ultimately determine whether you have happy franchisees or not.

                </p>`;
        let b = document.getElementById('exampleModalLabel1').innerHTML = "THE MARKET SAYS YES";
    }
    function OpenPdf3() {
        let a = document.getElementById('modal-body1');
   
        a.innerHTML = `      <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;padding: 10px;color: black;height: auto;">
                    So yes, big or small, the secret is to realise you are building two completely different business
                    structures from your current business and you will be doing business in a completely different way
                    in the future.
                    <br>
                    To tease out how you will organise these two sides of the business, so they work together, I have
                    found I need to look at every aspect of your business; not just marketing and support, but also how
                    the money works for both sides of the franchise in the long term, who is going to do what exactly,
                    how product is going to be supplied. The list of questions is endless.



                </p>`;
        let b = document.getElementById('exampleModalLabel1').innerHTML = "TWO SIDES OF THE SAME BUSINESS";
    }
    function OpenPdf4() {
        let a = document.getElementById('modal-body1');
   
        a.innerHTML = `    <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;padding: 10px;color: black;height: auto;">
                    How big do you need your franchise group to be? Do you have a simple business method which will suit
                    the largest number of potential franchisees or does the complexity in your business restrict the
                    market? How skilled do you need your franchisees to be?
                    <br>
                    I have discovered that people who choose to grow their businesses through franchising are
                    entrepreneurs. They are always looking for something new, and so most who come to me have businesses
                    with many layers.
                    <br>
                    Her story is not unusual. The thing is, these simple franchises appeal to a much wider range of
                    people in the franchisee market, so you get more applicants giving you more choice, so you can
                    select the best franchisees available, making it easier to expand the group.


                </p>`;
        let b = document.getElementById('exampleModalLabel1').innerHTML = "EXPANSION WITH CHOICE";
    }
    function OpenPdf5() {
        let a = document.getElementById('modal-body1');
   
        a.innerHTML = `   <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;padding: 10px;color: black;height: auto;">
                    So, right at the beginning, as you design your franchised business, you need to work out the money.
                <ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);text-align: justify;font-size: 15px; ">
                    <li>How much does each franchise outlet need to earn to be profitable enough to support you and
                        them?</li>
                    <li>How much does your product need to cost and sell for?</li>
                    <li>How many items do your franchisees need to sell each month?</li>
                    <li>Who are the people with the money and love of your product, and what are their characteristics?
                    </li>
                    <li>Where do they live and what are their habits?</li>
                    <li>What is the fee structure which will support your group as it begins and as it matures?</li>
                </ul>
                </p>`;
